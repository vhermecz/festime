# Privacy Policy

Vajk Hermecz ("Me", "Myself", and "I") built festive (the "app"). This service is provided by myself and is intended for use as is.

This Privacy Policy explains the types of data the app collects and how it processes and protects that data in connection with the service offered.

The collected information is required for maintaining the quality of the service, and iteratively improving it.

## Information collection and use

There are 3 categories of information captures by the app.

### Crash logs

NOTE: The below features are planned, but not yet implemented. Currently the app does not collect any user data.

These are anonymous records of crashes that occur in the app. These logs are used to identify and fix bugs in the app.
They contain no personal information.

### Tracking data

NOTE: The below features are planned, but not yet implemented. Currently the app does not collect any user data.

The app collects anonymous usage data to learn how users interact with the app and help improve its UX. This data might include the following:

- The screens you visit
- The actions you take
- The time spent on each screen
- Screen size, orientation and resolution
- Operating system and version

The data is not collected on a constant basis, but only occasionally to help improve the app, to better understand how it is used, and to identify potential issues.

The collected data does not contain any PII, and is not shared with any 3rd party services.

We generate a unique identifier for each user, which is stored in the app's local storage. This identifier is used to track the users interaction as a session. The identifier is not shared with any 3rd party services. The identifier is not linked to any PII. The identifier is not used to track the user across different apps or services. This identifier is destroyed every 30 days, leaving the collected data anonymous. Afterwards a new random identifier is generated.   

### User data

NOTE: The below features are planned, but not yet implemented. Currently the app does not collect any user data.

The app allows the user to:
- report incorrect information
- request improvements
- request new features
- provide feedback
- submit new information (e.g. new gigs)

When this information is submitted, the user can choose to provide their identity (OAuth social media identity e.g.: facebook, google, etc.) or remain anonymous. Providing an identity is optional. It has the following benefits:

- the app can notify them about updates related to their request
- their request is more likely to be addressed (less likely to be considered spam)

## Sharing of data with 3rd party services

User data is only shared with our technology providers (AWS, Sentry) and only for operational reasons. 

The app's backend is hosted on [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/console/). No user data is persisted besides the AWS cloud.

For the purpose of error tracking, error stacks are shared with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) ([Privacy notice](https://sentry.io/privacy/)).

## Security

Data between the browser extension and the backend is sent over HTTPS.

All data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

AWS's infrastructure is used to protect the backend.

GitHub's Dependabot keeps the backend code up to date and free of known vulnerabilities.

## Consent

By using the app, you hereby consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to its Terms and Conditions.

## Changes to this privacy policy

I may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect company and customer feedback. If there are any updates, I'll inform you by initiating a pull request on this repository, which will remain open for a minimum of 14 days, providing an opportunity for you to express any objections. These updates become effective immediately upon their integration into the main branch. I encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to be informed of how we protecting your information.

NOTE: It is planned to inform the user about privacy policy changes within the app.
